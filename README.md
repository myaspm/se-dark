# se-dark

Dark themes for various StackExchange sites. Still very much a work-in-progress.

Currently working on:

 - Ask Ubuntu (askubuntu.com)
  - Meta (meta.askubuntu.com)
  
 - Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com)
   - Meta (meta.stackoverflow.com)
   

If there's an element that hasn't been changed or something else looks bad, either submit a pull request with your changes or open a new issue.

#INSTALLATION

 1. You'll need Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) installed for this plugin to work properly.
 2. Once you have either one installed, simply click the link for the raw JS and you will be prompted to install it.
 3. You may need to restart your browser. You will need to refresh affected web pages.
